<h4>THE HAPPY PRINCE</h4>

<p><span class = "dropcap">
<img src = "images/capH.png" width = "136" height = "142"
alt = "H"></span><span class = "firstword">igh</span> above the city, on
a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince. He was gilded all
over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright
sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt.</p>

<p>He was very much admired indeed. “He is as beautiful as a
weathercock,” remarked
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having
artistic tastes; “only not quite so useful,” he added, fearing lest
people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.</p>

<p>“Why can’t you be like the Happy Prince?” asked a sensible mother of
her little boy who was crying for the moon. “The Happy Prince never
dreams of crying for anything.”</p>

<p>“I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,”
muttered a disappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.</p>

<p class = "figfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg16.png" width = "55" height = "232"
alt = "decoration"></p>

<p>“He looks just like an angel,” said the Charity Children as they came
out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean
white pinafores.</p>

<p>“How do you know?” said the Mathematical Master, “you have never seen
one.”</p>

<p>“Ah! but we have, in our dreams,” answered the children; and the
Mathematical
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not approve of
children dreaming.</p>

<p>One night there flew over the city a little Swallow. His friends had
gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he
was in love with the most beautiful Reed. He had met her early in the
spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had
been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to
her.</p>

<p class = "leftfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg17.png" width = "61" height = "312"
alt = "decoration"></p>

<p>“Shall I love you?” said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point
at once, and the Reed made him a low bow. So he flew round and round
her, touching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples. This
was his courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.</p>

<p>“It is a ridiculous attachment,” twittered the other Swallows; “she
has no money, and
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
far too many relations;” and indeed the river was quite full of Reeds.
Then, when the autumn came they all flew away.</p>

<p>After they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his
lady-love. “She has no conversation,” he said, “and I am afraid that she
is a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.” And certainly,
whenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys.
“I&nbsp;admit that she is domestic,” he continued, “but I love
travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling also.”</p>

<p>“Will you come away with me?” he said finally to her; but the Reed
shook her head, she was so attached to her home.</p>

<p>“You have been trifling with me,” he cried. “I am off to the
Pyramids. Good-bye!” and he flew away.</p>

<p>All day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city.
“Where shall I put up?”
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
he said; “I&nbsp;hope the town has made preparations.”</p>

<p class = "illustration left">
<img src = "images/b_pg18.png" width = "482" height = "59"
alt = "decoration"></p>

<p>Then he saw the statue on the tall column.</p>

<p>“I will put up there,” he cried; “it is a fine position, with plenty
of fresh air.” So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy
Prince.</p>

<p>“I have a golden bedroom,” he said softly to himself as he looked
round, and he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his
head under his wing a large drop of water fell on him. “What a curious
thing!” he cried; “there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are
quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining. The climate in the north
of Europe is really dreadful. The Reed used to like the rain, but that
was merely her selfishness.”</p>

<p>Then another drop fell.</p>

<p>“What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?” he
said; “I&nbsp;must look for
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
a good chimney-pot,” and he determined to fly away.</p>

<p>But before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked
up, and saw&mdash; Ah! what did he see?</p>

<p>The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were
running down his golden cheeks. His face was so beautiful in the
moonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he said.</p>

<p>“I am the Happy Prince.”</p>

<p>“Why are you weeping then?” asked the Swallow; “you have quite
drenched&nbsp;me.”</p>

THE PALACE OF SANS-SOUCI</p>

<p>“When I was alive and had a human heart,” answered the statue,
“I&nbsp;did not know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of
Sans-Souci, where sorrow is not allowed to enter. In the daytime I
played with my companions in the garden, and in the evening I led the
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
dance in the Great Hall. Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I
never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about me was so
beautiful. My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I
was, if pleasure be happiness. So I lived, and so I died. And now that I
am dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness
and all the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I
cannot choose but weep.”</p>

“What! is he not solid gold?” said the Swallow to himself. He was too
polite to make any personal remarks out loud.</p>

<p>“Far away,” continued the statue in a low musical voice, “far away in
a little street there is a poor house. One of the windows is open, and
through it I can see a woman seated at a table. Her face is thin and
worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle,
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
for she is a seamstress. She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin
gown for the loveliest of the Queen’s maids-of-honour to wear at the
next Court-ball. In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is
lying ill. He has a fever, and is asking for oranges. His mother has
nothing to give him but river water, so he is crying. Swallow, Swallow,
little Swallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt? My
feet are fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move.”</p>

<p>“I am waited for in Egypt,” said the Swallow. “My friends are flying
up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers. Soon they
will go to sleep in the tomb of the great King. The King is there
himself in his painted coffin. He is wrapped in yellow linen, and
embalmed with spices. Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and
his hands are like withered leaves.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
<p>“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not
stay with me for one night, and be my messenger? The boy is so thirsty,
and the mother so sad.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I like boys,” answered the Swallow. “Last summer, when
I was staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller’s sons,
who were always throwing stones at me. They never hit me, of course; we
swallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I&nbsp;come of a family
famous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.”</p>

<p>But the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry.
“It is very cold here,” he said; “but I will stay with you for one
night, and be your messenger.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, little Swallow,” said the Prince.</p>

<p>So the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince’s sword, and
flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
<p>He passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were
sculptured. He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing.
A&nbsp;beautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover. “How
wonderful the stars are,” he said to her, “and how wonderful is the
power of love!”</p>

<p>“I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,” she
answered; “I&nbsp;have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it;
but the seamstresses are so lazy.”</p>

<p>He passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts
of the ships. He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining
with each other, and weighing out money in copper scales. At last he
came to the poor house and looked in. The boy was tossing feverishly on
his bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired. In he
hopped, and laid the great ruby on the
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
table beside the woman’s thimble. Then he flew gently round the bed,
fanning the boy’s forehead with his wings. “How cool I feel!” said the
boy, “I&nbsp;must be getting better;” and he sank into a delicious
slumber.</p>

<p>Then the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he
had done. “It is curious,” he remarked, “but I feel quite warm now,
although it is so cold.”</p>

<p>“That is because you have done a good action,” said the Prince. And
the little Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep. Thinking
always made him sleepy.</p>

<p class = "figfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg26.png" width = "119" height = "322"

<p>When day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath. “What a
remarkable phenomenon<ins class = "correction" title = "comma invisible">,”</ins>
said the Professor of Ornithology as he was passing
over the bridge. “A&nbsp;swallow in winter!” And he wrote a long letter
about it to the local newspaper. Every one quoted it, it was
<span class = "pagenum">26</span>
full of so many words that they could not understand.</p>

</div>

<p>“To-night I go to Egypt,” said the Swallow, and he was in high
spirits at the prospect. He visited all the public monuments, and sat a
long time on top of the church steeple. Wherever he went the Sparrows
chirruped, and said to each other, “What a distinguished stranger!” so
he enjoyed himself very much.</p>

<p>When the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince. “Have you any
commissions for Egypt?” he cried; “I&nbsp;am just starting.”</p>

<p>“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not
stay with me one night longer?”</p>

THE LOVELIEST OF THE QUEEN’S MAIDS OF HONOUR</p>

<p>“I am waited for in Egypt,” answered the Swallow. “To-morrow my
friends will fly up to the Second Cataract. The river-horse couches
there among the bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God
Memnon.
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
All night long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he
utters one cry of joy, and then he is silent. At noon the yellow lions
come down to the water’s edge to drink. They have eyes like green
beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.”</p>

<p>“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “far away across
the city I see a young man in a garret. He is leaning over a desk
covered with papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of
withered violets. His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a
pomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes. He is trying to finish a
play for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any
more. There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint.”</p>

<p>“I will wait with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, who really
had a good heart. “Shall I take him another ruby?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
<p>“Alas! I have no ruby now,” said the Prince; “my eyes are all that I
have left. They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of
India a thousand years ago. Pluck out one of them and take it to him. He
will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish his
play.”</p>

<p>“Dear Prince,” said the Swallow, “I cannot do that”; and he began to
weep.</p>

<p>“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command
you.”</p>

<p>So the Swallow plucked out the Prince’s eye, and flew away to the
student’s garret. It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in
the roof. Through this he darted, and came into the room. The young man
had his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the
bird’s wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire
lying on the withered violets.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">29</span>

<p class = "figfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg29.png" width = "45" height = "310"
alt = "crow's nest"></p>

<p>“I am beginning to be appreciated,” he cried; “this is from some
great admirer. Now I can finish my play,” and he looked quite happy.</p>

<p>The next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour. He sat on the mast
of a large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the
hold with ropes. “Heave a-hoy!” they shouted as each chest came up.
“I&nbsp;am going to Egypt!” cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and
when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.</p>

<p>“I am come to bid you good-bye,” he cried.</p>

<p>“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not
stay with me one night longer?”</p>

<p>“It is winter,” answered the Swallow, “and the chill snow will soon
be here. In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the
crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
about them. My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec,
and the pink and white doves are watching them, and cooing to each
other. Dear Prince, I&nbsp;must leave you, but I will never forget you,
and next spring I will bring you back two beautiful jewels in place of
those you have given away. The ruby shall be redder than a red rose, and
the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea.”</p>

<p class = "leftfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg30.png" width = "46" height = "309"
alt = "match-girl"></p>

<p>“In the square below,” said the Happy Prince, “there stands a little
match-girl. She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all
spoiled. Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money,
and she is crying. She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is
bare. Pluck out my other eye and give it to her, and her father will not
beat her.”</p>

<p>“I will stay with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, “but I
cannot pluck out
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
your eye. You would be quite blind then.”</p>

<p>“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command
you.”</p>

<p>So he plucked out the Prince’s other eye, and darted down with it. He
swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her
hand. “What a lovely bit of glass!” cried the little girl; and she ran
home, laughing.</p>

<p>Then the Swallow came back to the Prince. “You are blind now,” he
said, “so I will stay with you always.”</p>

<p>“No, little Swallow,” said the poor Prince, “you must go away to
Egypt.”</p>

<p>“I will stay with you always,” said the Swallow, and he slept at the
Prince’s feet.</p>

<p>All the next day he sat on the Prince’s shoulder, and told him
stories of what he had seen in strange lands. He told him of the red
ibises, who stand in long rows on the
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their beaks; of the Sphinx,
who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the desert, and knows
everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the side of their
camels and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King of the
Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a large
crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm tree, and has
twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail
over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the
butterflies.</p>

<p>“Dear little Swallow,” said the Prince, “you tell me of marvellous
things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of
women. There is no Mystery so great as Misery. Fly over my city, little
Swallow, and tell me what you see there.”</p>

THE RICH MAKING MERRY IN THEIR BEAUTIFUL HOUSES,<br>
WHILE THE BEGGARS WERE SITTING AT THE GATES</p>

<p>So the Swallow flew over the great city, and
<span class = "pagenum">33</span>
saw the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars
were sitting at the gates. He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white
faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets.
Under the archway of a bridge two little boys were lying in one
another’s arms to try and keep themselves warm. “How hungry we are!”
they said. “You must not lie here,” shouted the Watchman, and they
wandered out into the rain.</p>

<p>Then he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.</p>

<p>“I am covered with fine gold,” said the Prince, “you must take it
off, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that
gold can make them happy.”</p>

<p>Leaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the
Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey. Leaf after leaf of the fine
gold he brought to the poor, and the children’s
<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
faces grew rosier, and they laughed and played games in the street. “We
have bread now!” they cried.</p>

<p>Then the snow came, and after the snow came the frost. The streets
looked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and
glistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves
of the houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore
scarlet caps and skated on the ice.</p>

<p>The poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not
leave the Prince, he loved him too well. He picked up crumbs outside the
baker’s door when the baker was not looking, and tried to keep himself
warm by flapping his wings.</p>

<p>But at last he knew that he was going to die. He had just strength to
fly up to the Prince’s shoulder once more. “Good-bye,
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
dear Prince!” he murmured, “will you let me kiss your hand?”</p>

<p>“I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,” said
the Prince, “you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the
lips, for I love you.”</p>

<p>“It is not to Egypt that I am going,” said the Swallow. “I&nbsp;am
going to the House of Death. Death is the brother of Sleep, is he
not?”</p>

<p class = "figfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg35.png" width = "95" height = "149"
alt = "prince and sparrow"></p>

<p>And he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his
feet.</p>

<p>At that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if
something had broken. The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped
right in two. It certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in
company with the Town Councillors. As they passed the column he looked
up at the statue: “Dear
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!” he said.</p>

<!-- b_pg36.png width = "434" height = "434" -->

“How shabby, indeed!” cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with
the Mayor; and they went up to look at&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>“The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is
golden no longer,” said the Mayor; “in fact, he is little better than a
beggar!”</p>

<p>“Little better than a beggar,” said the Town Councillors.</p>

<p>“And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!” continued the Mayor.
“We must really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to
die here.” And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion.</p>

<p>So they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince. “As he is no
longer beautiful he is no longer useful,” said the Art Professor at the
University.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">37</span>
<p>Then they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a
meeting of the Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal.
“We must have another statue, of course,” he said, “and it shall be a
statue of myself.”</p>

<p>“Of myself,” said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.
When I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.</p>

<p>“What a strange thing!” said the overseer of the workmen at the
foundry. “This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace. We must
throw it away.” So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow
was also lying.</p>

<p>“No red rose in all my garden!” he cried, and his beautiful eyes

I told his story to the stars, and now I see him. His hair is dark as
the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire;
but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her
seal upon his brow.”</p>

<p>“The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night,” murmured the young
Student, “and my love will be of the company. If I bring her a red rose
she will dance with me till dawn. If I bring her a red rose,
I&nbsp;shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my
shoulder,
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
and her hand will be clasped in mine. But there is no red rose in my
garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by. She will have no

<p>“Here indeed is the true lover,” said the Nightingale. “What I sing
of, he suffers: what is joy to me, to him is pain. Surely Love is a
wonderful thing. It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine
opals. Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the
market-place. It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be
weighed out in the balance for gold.”</p>

<p>“The musicians will sit in their gallery,” said the young Student,
“and play upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the
sound of the harp and the violin. She will dance so lightly that her
feet will not touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses
will throng round her. But with me she will not
<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
dance, for I have no red rose to give her;” and he flung himself down on
the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept.</p>

“There is a way,” answered the Tree; “but it is so terrible that I dare
not tell it to you.”</p>

<p>“Tell it to me,” said the Nightingale, “I am not afraid.”</p>

<p>“If you want a red rose,” said the Tree, “you must build it out of
music by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart’s-blood. You must
sing to me with your breast against a thorn. All night long you must
sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood
must flow into my veins, and become mine.”</p>

<p>“Death is a great price to pay for a red rose,” cried the
Nightingale, “and Life is very dear to all. It is pleasant to sit in the
green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in
her chariot of pearl. Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on
the hill. Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird
compared to the heart of a man?”</p>

<p>So she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.
She swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed
through the grove.</p>

<p>The young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left
him, and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>“Be happy,” cried the Nightingale, “be happy; you shall have your red
rose. I&nbsp;will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with
my own heart’s-blood. All that I ask of you in return is that you will
be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though he is wise,
and mightier than Power, though he is mighty. Flame-coloured are his
wings, and coloured like flame is his body. His lips are
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
sweet as honey, and his breath is like frankincense.”</p>

HIS LIPS ARE SWEET AS HONEY</p>

<p>The Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not
understand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the
things that are written down in books.</p>

<p class = "figfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg49.png" width = "55" height = "252"

<p>But the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of
the little Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.</p>

<p>“Sing me one last song,” he whispered; “I shall feel very lonely when
you are gone.”</p>

<p>So the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water
bubbling from a silver jar.</p>

<p>When she had finished her song, the Student got up, and pulled a
note-book and a lead-pencil out of his pocket.</p>

<p>“She has form,” he said to himself, as he walked away through the
grove&mdash;“that cannot be denied to her; but has she got feeling?
I&nbsp;<span class = "pagenum">50</span>
am afraid not. In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style
without any sincerity. She would not sacrifice herself for others. She
thinks merely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish.
Still, it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her
voice. What a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any
practical good!” And he went into his room, and lay down on his little
pallet-bed, and began to think of his love; and, after a time, he fell
asleep.</p>

<p class = "leftfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg50.png" width = "57" height = "250"
alt = "tree"></p>

<p>And when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the
Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn. All night long she sang
with her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down
and listened. All night long she sang and the thorn went deeper and
deeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her.</p>

<p>She sang first of the birth of love in the
<span class = "pagenum">51</span>
heart of a boy and a girl. And on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree
there blossomed a marvellous rose, petal following petal, as song
followed song. Pale was it, at first, as the mist that hangs over the
river&mdash;pale as the feet of the morning, and silver as the wings of
the dawn. As the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, as the shadow
of a rose in a water-pool, so was the rose that blossomed on the topmost
spray of the Tree.</p>

<p class = "figfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg51.png" width = "58" height = "121"
alt = "rose"></p>

<p>But the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the
thorn. “Press closer, little Nightingale,” cried the Tree, “or the Day
will come before the rose is finished.”</p>

<p>So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and
louder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul
of a man and a maid.</p>

<p>And a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like
the flush in the face of
<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride. But the thorn had
not yet reached her heart, so the rose’s heart remained white, for only
a Nightingale’s heart’s-blood can crimson the heart of a rose.</p>

<p>And the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the
thorn. “Press closer, little Nightingale,” cried the Tree, “or the Day
will come before the rose is finished.”</p>

<p class = "leftfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg52.png" width = "125" height = "161"

<p>So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn
touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her. Bitter,
bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang
of the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the
tomb.</p>

<p>And the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern
sky. Crimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the
heart.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
<p>But the Nightingale’s voice grew fainter, and her little wings began
to beat, and a film came over her eyes. Fainter and fainter grew her
song, and she felt something choking her in her throat.</p>

<p>Then she gave one last burst of music. The white Moon heard it, and
she forgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky. The red rose heard it,
and it trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold
morning air. Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke
the sleeping shepherds from their dreams. It floated through the reeds
of the river, and they carried its message to the sea.</p>

<p class = "figfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg53.png" width = "94" height = "198"

<p>“Look, look!” cried the Tree, “the rose is finished now;” but the
Nightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long grass,
with the thorn in her heart.</p>

<p>And at noon the Student opened his window and looked out.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
<p>“Why, what a wonderful piece of luck!” he cried; “here is a red rose!
I&nbsp;have never seen any rose like it in all my life. It is so
beautiful that I am sure it has a long Latin name;” and he leaned down
and plucked&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Then he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professor’s house with the
rose in his hand.</p>

<p>The daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue
silk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.</p>

<p class = "leftfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg54.png" width = "165" height = "177"
alt = "the Student"></p>

<p>“You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose,”
cried the Student. “Here is the reddest rose in all the world. You will
wear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell
you how I love you.”</p>

<p>But the girl frowned. “I am afraid it will not go with my dress,” she
answered; “and, besides, the Chamberlain’s nephew
<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
has sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far
more than flowers.”</p>

<p>“Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful,” said the Student
angrily; and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the
gutter, and a cart-wheel went over&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>“Ungrateful!” said the girl. “I tell you what, you are very rude;
and, after all, who are you? Only a Student. Why, I&nbsp;don’t believe
you have even got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain’s
nephew has;” and she got up from her chair and went into the house.</p>

<p>“What a silly thing Love is!” said the Student as he walked away. “It
is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it
is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making
one believe things that are not true. In fact, it is quite unpractical,
and, as in this age to be practical is everything,
<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics.”</p>

<p>So he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and
began to read.</p>

<h4>THE SELFISH GIANT</h4>

<p><span class = "dropcap">
<img src = "images/capE.png" width = "140" height = "141"
alt = "E"></span><span class = "firstword">very</span> afternoon, as
they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the
Giant’s garden.</p>

<p>It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass. Here and there
over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve
peach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into delicate blossoms of
pink and pearl,
<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
and in the autumn bore rich fruit. The birds sat on the trees and sang
so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen
to them. “How happy we are here!” they cried to each other.</p>

<p>One day the Giant came back. He had been to visit his friend the
Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years. After the seven
years were over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation
was limited, and he determined to return to his own castle. When he
arrived he saw the children playing in the garden.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” he cried in a very gruff voice, and the
children ran away.</p>

<p>“My own garden is my own garden,” said the Giant; “any one can
understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself.” So
he built a high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">61</span>
<p class = "sign">
TRESPASSERS<br>
<span class = "smaller">WILL BE</span><br>
PROSECUTED</p>

<p>He was a very selfish Giant.</p>

<p>The poor children had now nowhere to play. They tried to play on the
road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did
not like it. They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons
were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside. “How happy we
were there!” they said to each other.</p>

<p class = "figfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg62.png" width = "71" height = "253"
alt = "wind"></p>

<p>Then the Spring came, and all over the country there were little
blossoms and little birds. Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it
was still winter. The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no
children, and the trees forgot to blossom. Once a beautiful flower put
its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so
sorry for the children
<span class = "pagenum">62</span>
that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep. The
only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost. “Spring has
forgotten this garden,” they cried, “so we will live here all the year
round.” The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and
the Frost painted all the trees silver. Then they invited the North Wind
to stay with them, and he came. He was wrapped in furs, and he roared
all day about the garden, and blew the chimney-pots down. “This is a
delightful spot,” he said, “we must ask the Hail on a visit.” So the
Hail came. Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the
castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round
the garden as fast as he could go. He was dressed in grey, and his
breath was like ice.</p>

<p>“I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming,” said the
Selfish Giant, as he
<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
sat at the window and looked out at his cold white garden; “I&nbsp;hope
there will be a change in the weather.”</p>

<p class = "leftfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg63.png" width = "60" height = "221"
alt = "castle"></p>

<p>But the Spring never came, nor the Summer. The Autumn gave golden
fruit to every garden, but to the Giant’s garden she gave none. “He is
too selfish,” she said. So it was always Winter there, and the North
Wind and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the
trees.</p>

<p>One morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some
lovely music. It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be
the King’s musicians passing by. It was really only a little linnet
singing outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird
sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music
in the world. Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North
Wind ceased roaring,
<span class = "pagenum">64</span>
and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement.
“I&nbsp;believe the Spring has come at last,” said the Giant; and he
jumped out of bed and looked out.</p>

<p>What did he see?</p>

<p>He saw a most wonderful sight. Through a little hole in the wall the
children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the
trees. In every tree that he could see there was a little child. And the
trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered
themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above the
children’s heads. The birds were flying about and twittering with
delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and
laughing. It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter.
It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a
little boy.</p>

<p class = "illustration plate">
<a name = "plate64" id = "plate64">&nbsp;</a><br>
<span class = "pagenum">64a</span>
<img src = "images/c_plate64.jpg" width = "400" height = "510"
alt = "see caption"></p>

<p class = "caption">
IN EVERY TREE HE COULD SEE THERE WAS A LITTLE CHILD</p>

<p>He was so small that he could not reach up to
<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying
bitterly. The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and
the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it. “Climb up! little boy,”
said the Tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it could; but the
boy was too tiny.</p>

<p>And the Giant’s heart melted as he looked out. “How selfish I have
been!” he said; “now I know why the Spring would not come here.
I&nbsp;will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I
will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children’s
playground for ever and ever.” He was really very sorry for what he had
done.</p>

<p>So he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and
went out into the garden. But when the children saw him they were so
frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again.
Only the little boy
<span class = "pagenum">66</span>
did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the
Giant coming. And the Giant stole up behind him and took him gently in
his hand, and put him up into the tree. And the tree broke at once into
blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched
out his two arms and flung them round the Giant’s neck, and kissed him.
And the other children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any
longer, came running back, and with them came the Spring. “It is your
garden now, little children,” said the Giant, and he took a great axe
and knocked down the wall. And when the people were going to market at
twelve o’clock they found the Giant playing with the children in the
most beautiful garden they had ever seen.</p>

<p class = "leftfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg66.png" width = "107" height = "159"
alt = "the Giant"></p>

<p>All day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant
to bid him good-bye.</p>

<p>“But where is your little companion?” he
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
said: “the boy I put into the tree.” The Giant loved him the best
because he had kissed him.</p>

<p>“We don’t know,” answered the children; “he has gone away.”</p>

<p>“You must tell him to be sure and come here to-morrow,” said the
Giant. But the children said that they did not know where he lived, and
had never seen him before; and the Giant felt very sad.</p>

<p class = "figfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg67.png" width = "40" height = "221"
alt = "poppy"></p>

<p>Every afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played
with the Giant. But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen
again. The Giant was very kind to all the children, yet he longed for
his first little friend, and often spoke of him. “How I would like to
see him!” he used to say.</p>

<p>Years went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble. He could not
play about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched
<span class = "pagenum">68</span>
the children at their games, and admired his garden. “I&nbsp;have many
beautiful flowers,” he said; “but the children are the most beautiful
flowers of all.”</p>

<p>One winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing. He
did not hate the winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring
asleep, and that the flowers were resting.</p>

<p>Suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder and looked and looked. It
certainly was a marvellous sight. In the farthest corner of the garden
was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms. Its branches were
all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it
stood the little boy he had loved.</p>

<p class = "caption">
THE LITTLE BOY HE HAD LOVED</p>

<p>Downstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden. He
hastened across the grass, and came near to the child. And when he came
quite close his face grew red with
<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
anger, and he said, “Who hath dared to wound thee?” For on the palms of
the child’s hands were the prints of two nails, and the prints of two
nails were on the little feet.</p>

<p>“Who hath dared to wound thee?” cried the Giant; “tell me, that I
might take my big sword and slay him.”</p>

<p>“Nay!” answered the child; “but these are the wounds of Love.”</p>

<p>“Who art thou?” said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he
knelt before the little child.</p>

<p>And the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, “You let me play
once in your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which
is Paradise.”</p>

<p>And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant
lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.</p>

<img src = "images/capO.png" width = "140" height = "139"

Water-rat put his head out of his hole. He had bright beady eyes and
stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long bit of black
india-rubber. The little ducks were swimming about in the pond, looking
just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who was pure white
with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand on their heads
in the water.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
<p>“You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your
heads,” she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed them
how it was done. But the little ducks paid no attention to her. They
were so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in
society at all.</p>

<p>“What disobedient children!” cried the old Water-rat; “they really
deserve to be drowned.”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the kind,” answered the Duck, “every one must make a
beginning, and parents cannot be too patient.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents,” said the
Water-rat; “I&nbsp;am not a family man. In fact, I&nbsp;have never been
married, and I never intend to be. Love is all very well in its way, but
friendship is much higher. Indeed, I&nbsp;know of nothing in the world
that is either nobler or rarer than a devoted friendship.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">75</span>
<p>“And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?”
asked a green Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had
overheard the conversation.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is just what I want to know,” said the Duck; and she swam
away to the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give
her children a good example.</p>

<p>“What a silly question!” cried the Water-rat. “I should expect my
devoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.”</p>

<p>“And what would you do in return?” said the little bird, swinging
upon a silver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you,” answered the Water-rat.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you a story on the subject,” said the Linnet.</p>

<p>“Is the story about me?” asked the Water-rat.
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
“If so, I&nbsp;will listen to it, for I am extremely fond of
fiction.”</p>

<p>“It is applicable to you,” answered the Linnet; and he flew down, and
alighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.</p>

<p>“Once upon a time,” said the Linnet, “there was an honest little
fellow named Hans.”</p>

<p>“Was he very distinguished?” asked the Water-rat.</p>

<p>“No,” answered the Linnet, “I don’t think he was distinguished at
all, except for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face.
He lived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in
his garden. In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as
his. Sweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds’-purses,
and Fair-maids of France. There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses,
lilac Crocuses and
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
gold, purple Violets and white. Columbine and Ladysmock, Marjoram and
Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil and the
Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the months went
by, one flower taking another flower’s place, so that there were always
beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.</p>

THE GREEN LINNET</p>

<p>“Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of
all was big Hugh the Miller. Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to
little Hans, that he would never go by his garden without leaning over
the wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or
filling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit
season.</p>

<p>“‘Real friends should have everything in common,’ the Miller used to
say, and little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a
friend with such noble ideas.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
<p>“Sometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich
Miller never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a
hundred sacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows, and
a large flock of woolly sheep; but Hans never troubled his head about
these things, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to
all the wonderful things the Miller used to say about the unselfishness
of true friendship.</p>

“So little Hans worked away in his garden. During the spring, the
summer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and
he had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good
deal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper
but a few dried pears or some hard nuts. In the winter, also, he was
extremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.</p>

<p>“‘There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow
lasts,’ the Miller used to say to his wife, ‘for when people are in
trouble they should be left alone and not be bothered by visitors. That
at least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right. So I
shall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and
he will be able to give me a large basket of primroses, and that will
make him so happy.’</p>

<p>“‘You are certainly very thoughtful about others,’ answered the Wife,
as she sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire; ‘very
thoughtful indeed. It is quite a treat to hear you talk about
friendship. I&nbsp;am sure the clergyman himself could not say such
beautiful things as you do, though he does live in a three-storied
house, and wear a gold ring on his little finger.’</p>

<p>“‘But could we not ask little Hans up
<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
here?’ said the Miller’s youngest son. ‘If poor Hans is in trouble I
will give him half my porridge, and show him my white rabbits.’</p>

<p>“‘What a silly boy you are!’ cried the Miller; ‘I really don’t know
what is the use of sending you to school. You seem not to learn
anything. Why, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and
our good supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious,
and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody’s nature.
I&nbsp;certainly will not allow Hans’ nature to be spoiled. I&nbsp;am
his best friend, and I will always watch over him, and see that he is
not led into any temptations. Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask
me to let him have some flour on credit, and that I could not do. Flour
is one thing and friendship is another, and they should not be confused.
Why, the words are spelt differently, and mean
<span class = "pagenum">81</span>
quite different things. Everybody can see that.’</p>

<p>“‘How well you talk!’ said the Miller’s Wife, pouring herself out a
large glass of warm ale; ‘really I feel quite drowsy. It is just like
being in church.’</p>

<p>“‘Lots of people act well,’ answered the Miller; ‘but very few people
talk well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of
the two, and much the finer thing also’; and he looked sternly across
the table at his little son, who felt so ashamed of himself that he hung
his head down, and grew quite scarlet, and began to cry into his tea.
However, he was so young that you must excuse him.”</p>

<p>“Is that the end of the story?” asked the Water-rat.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” answered the Linnet, “that is the beginning.”</p>

<p>“Then you are quite behind the age,” said
<span class = "pagenum">82</span>
the Water-rat. “Every good story-teller nowadays starts with the end,
and then goes on to the beginning, and concludes with the middle. That
is the new method. I&nbsp;heard all about it the other day from a critic
who was walking round the pond with a young man. He spoke of the matter
at great length, and I am sure he must have been right, for he had blue
spectacles and a bald head, and whenever the young man made any remark,
he always answered ‘Pooh!’ But pray go on with your story. I&nbsp;like
the Miller immensely. I&nbsp;have all kinds of beautiful sentiments
myself, so there is a great sympathy between&nbsp;us.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the other,
“as soon as the winter was over, and the primroses
<span class = "pagenum">83</span>
began to open their pale yellow stars, the Miller said to his wife that
he would go down and see little Hans.</p>

<p>“‘Why, what a good heart you have!’ cried his Wife; ‘you are always
thinking of others. And mind you take the big basket with you for the
flowers.’</p>

<p>“So the Miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a strong
iron chain, and went down the hill with the basket on his arm.</p>

<p>“‘Good morning, little Hans,’ said the Miller.</p>

<p>“‘Good morning,’ said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from
ear to ear.</p>

<p>“‘And how have you been all the winter?’ said the Miller.</p>

<p>“‘Well, really,’ cried Hans, ‘it is very good of you to ask, very
good indeed. I&nbsp;am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now
the spring has come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing
well<ins class = "correction" title = "text has ” for ’">.’</ins></p>

<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
<p>“‘We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,’ said the Miller,
‘and wondered how you were getting&nbsp;on.’</p>

<p>“‘That was kind of you,’ said Hans; ‘I was half afraid you had
forgotten&nbsp;me.’</p>

<p>“‘Hans, I am surprised at you,’ said the Miller; ‘friendship never
forgets. That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don’t
understand the poetry of life. How lovely your primroses are looking,
by-the-bye!’</p>

<p>“‘They are certainly very lovely,’ said Hans, ‘and it is a most lucky
thing for me that I have so many. I&nbsp;am going to bring them into the
market and sell them to the Burgomaster’s daughter, and buy back my
wheelbarrow with the money.’</p>

<p>“‘Buy back your wheelbarrow? You don’t mean to say you have sold it?
What a very stupid thing to&nbsp;do!’</p>

<span class = "pagenum">85</span>
<p>“‘Well, the fact is,’ said Hans, ‘that I was obliged to. You see the
winter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to
buy bread with. So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat,
and then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at
last I sold my wheelbarrow. But I am going to buy them all back again
now.’</p>

<p>“‘Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘I will give you my wheelbarrow. It is not
in very good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something
wrong with the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you.
I&nbsp;know it is very generous of me, and a great many people would
think me extremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the
rest of the world. I&nbsp;think that generosity is the essence of
friendship, and, besides, I&nbsp;have got a new wheelbarrow for myself.
Yes, you may
<span class = "pagenum">86</span>
set your mind at ease, I&nbsp;will give you my wheelbarrow.’</p>

<p class = "figfloat">

<p>“‘Well, really, that is generous of you,’ said little Hans, and his
funny round face glowed all over with pleasure. ‘I&nbsp;can easily put
it in repair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.’</p>

<p>“‘A plank of wood!’ said the Miller; ‘why, that is just what I want
for the roof of my barn. There is a very large hole in it, and the corn
will all get damp if I don’t stop it up. How lucky you mentioned it! It
is quite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.
I&nbsp;have given you my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me
your plank. Of course, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank,
but true friendship never notices things like that. Pray get it at once,
and I will set to work at my barn this very day.’</p>

<span class = "pagenum">87</span>
<p>“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged
the plank out.</p>

<p>“‘It is not a very big plank,’ said the Miller, looking at it, ‘and I
am afraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won’t be any left
for you to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my
fault. And now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I&nbsp;am sure you
would like to give me some flowers in return. Here is the basket, and
mind you fill it quite full.’</p>

<p>“‘Quite full?’ said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was
really a very big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have
no flowers left for the market, and he was very anxious to get his
silver buttons back.</p>

<p>“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘as I have given you my
wheelbarrow, I&nbsp;don’t think that it is much to ask you for a few
flowers. I&nbsp;may be wrong, but I should have thought
<span class = "pagenum">88</span>
that friendship, true friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any
kind.’</p>

<p>“‘My dear friend, my best friend,’ cried little Hans, ‘you are
welcome to all the flowers in my garden. I&nbsp;would much sooner have
your good opinion than my silver buttons, any day;’ and he ran and
plucked all his pretty primroses, and filled the Miller’s basket.</p>
</div>

<p>“‘Good-bye, little Hans,’ said the Miller, as he went up the hill
with the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.</p>

<p>“‘Good-bye,’ said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite
merrily, he was so pleased about the wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>“The next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch,
when he heard the Miller’s voice calling to him from the road. So he
jumped off the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the
wall.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">89</span>
<p>“There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.</p>

<p>“‘Dear little Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘would you mind carrying this
sack of flour for me to market?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, I am so sorry,’ said Hans, ‘but I am really very busy to-day.
I&nbsp;have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water,
and all my grass to roll.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, really,’ said the Miller, ‘I think that, considering that I
am going to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to
refuse.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, don’t say that,’ cried little Hans, ‘I wouldn’t be unfriendly
for the whole world;’ and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with
the big sack on his shoulders.</p>

<p>“It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before
Hans had reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had
<span class = "pagenum">90</span>
to sit down and rest. However, he went on bravely, and at last he
reached the market. After he had waited there some time, he sold the
sack of flour for a very good price, and then he returned home at once,
for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers
on the way.</p>

<p>“‘It has certainly been a hard day,’ said little Hans to himself as
he was going to bed, ‘but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he
is my best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his
wheelbarrow.’</p>

<p>“Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his
sack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in
bed.</p>

<p>“‘Upon my word,’ said the Miller, ‘you are very lazy. Really,
considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I&nbsp;think you
might work harder. Idleness is a great
<span class = "pagenum">91</span>
sin, and I certainly don’t like any of my friends to be idle or
sluggish. You must not mind my speaking quite plainly to you. Of course
I should not dream of doing so if I were not your friend. But what is
the good of friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means? Anybody
can say charming things and try to please and to flatter, but a true
friend always says unpleasant things, and does not mind giving pain.
Indeed, if he is a really true friend he prefers it, for he knows that
then he is doing good.’</p>

<p>“‘I am very sorry,’ said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling
off his night-cap, ‘but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed
for a little time, and listen to the birds singing. Do you know that I
always work better after hearing the birds sing?’</p>

<p>“‘Well, I am glad of that,’ said the Miller, clapping little Hans on
the back, ‘for I want
<span class = "pagenum">92</span>
you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed and mend my
barn-roof for&nbsp;me.’</p>

<p>“Poor little Hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden, for
his flowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not like to
refuse the Miller as he was such a good friend to him.</p>

<p>“‘Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?’ he
inquired in a shy and timid voice.</p>

<p>“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘I do not think it is much to
ask of you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow; but
of course if you refuse I will go and do it myself.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh! on no account,’ cried little Hans; and he jumped out of bed,
and dressed himself, and went up to the barn.</p>

<p>“He worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the Miller
came to see how he was getting&nbsp;on.</p>

HANS IN HIS GARDEN</p>

<span class = "pagenum">93</span>
<p>“‘Have you mended the hole in the roof yet, little Hans?’ cried the
Miller in a cheery voice.</p>

<p>“‘It is quite mended,’ answered little Hans, coming down the
ladder.</p>

<p>“‘Ah!’ said the Miller, ‘there is no work so delightful as the work
one does for others.’</p>

<p>“‘It is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk,’ answered
little Hans, sitting down and wiping his forehead, ‘a&nbsp;very great
privilege. But I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as
you have.’</p>

<p class = "leftfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg93.png" width = "50" height = "240"
alt = "Hans in silhouette"></p>

<p>“‘Oh! they will come to you,’ said the Miller, ‘but you must take
more pains. At present you have only the practice of friendship; some
day you will have the theory also.’</p>

<p>“‘Do you really think I shall?’ asked little Hans.</p>

<p>“‘I have no doubt of it,’ answered the Miller, ‘but now that you have
mended the
<span class = "pagenum">94</span>
roof, you had better go home and rest, for I want you to drive my sheep
to the mountain to-morrow.’</p>

<p>“Poor little Hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the
next morning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and Hans
started off with them to the mountain. It took him the whole day to get
there and back; and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to
sleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it was broad daylight.</p>

<p>“‘What a delightful time I shall have in my garden!’ he said, and he
went to work at once.</p>

<p>“But somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for
his friend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on
long errands, or getting him to help at the mill. Little Hans was very
much distressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers
<span class = "pagenum">95</span>
would think he had forgotten them, but he consoled himself by the
reflection that the Miller was his best friend. ‘Besides,’ he used to
say, ‘he is going to give me his wheelbarrow, and that is an act of pure
generosity.’</p>

<p>“So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all
kinds of beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a
notebook, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good
scholar.</p>

<p class = "figfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg95.png" width = "92" height = "203"

<p>“Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his
fireside when a loud rap came at the door. It was a very wild night, and
the wind was blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at
first he thought it was merely the storm. But a second rap came, and
then a third, louder than any of the others.</p>

<p>“‘It is some poor traveller,’ said little Hans to himself, and he ran
to the door.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">96</span>
<p>“There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in
the other.</p>

<p>“‘Dear little Hans,’ cried the Miller, ‘I am in great trouble. My
little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for
the Doctor. But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that
it has just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went
instead of me. You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so it
is only fair that you should do something for me in return.’</p>

<p>“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, ‘I take it quite as a compliment
your coming to me, and I will start off at once. But you must lend me
your lantern, as the night is so dark that I am afraid I might fall into
the ditch.’</p>

<p>“‘I am very sorry,’ answered the Miller, ‘but it is my new lantern
and it would be a great loss to me if anything happened to&nbsp;it.’</p>

<span class = "pagenum">97</span>
<p>“‘Well, never mind, I will do without it,’ cried little Hans, and he
took down his great fur coat, and his warm scarlet cap, and tied a
muffler round his throat, and started off.</p>

<p>“What a dreadful storm it was! The night was so black that little
Hans could hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely
stand. However, he was very courageous, and after he had been walking
about three hours, he arrived at the Doctor’s house, and knocked at the
door.</p>

<p>“‘Who is there?’ cried the Doctor, putting his head out of his
bedroom window.</p>

<p>“‘Little Hans, Doctor.’</p>

<p>“‘What do you want, little Hans?’</p>

<p>“‘The Miller’s son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself,
and the Miller wants you to come at once.’</p>

<p>“‘All right!’ said the Doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his big
boots, and his
<span class = "pagenum">98</span>
lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the direction of the
Miller’s house, little Hans trudging behind him.</p>

<p>“But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents,
and little Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the
horse. At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was
a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor
little Hans was drowned. His body was found the next day by some
goatherds, floating in a great pool of water, and was brought back by
them to the cottage.</p>

<p>“Everybody went to little Hans’ funeral, as he was so popular, and
the Miller was the chief mourner.</p>

<p>“‘As I was his best friend,’ said the Miller, ‘it is only fair that I
should have the best place;’ so he walked at the head of the procession
in a long black cloak, and every now
<span class = "pagenum">99</span>
and then he wiped his eyes with a big pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>“‘Little Hans is certainly a great loss to every one,’ said the
Blacksmith, when the funeral was over, and they were all seated
comfortably in the inn, drinking spiced wine and eating sweet cakes.</p>

paddling up some minutes afterwards. “He has a great many good points,
but for my own part I have a mother’s feelings, and I can never look at
a confirmed bachelor without the tears coming into my eyes.”</p>

<p>“I am rather afraid that I have annoyed him,” answered the Linnet.
“The fact is, that I told him a story with a moral.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that is always a very dangerous thing to do,” said the Duck.</p>

<p>And I quite agree with her.</p>

going to be married, so there were general rejoicings. He had waited a
whole year for his bride, and at last she had arrived. She was a Russian
Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a sledge drawn by
six reindeer. The sledge was shaped like a great golden swan, and
between the swan’s wings lay the little Princess herself. Her long
ermine cloak reached right down to
<span class = "pagenum">106</span>
her feet, on her head was a tiny cap of silver tissue, and she was as
pale as the Snow Palace in which she had always lived. So pale was she
that as she drove through the streets all the people wondered. “She is
like a white rose!” they cried, and they threw down flowers on her from
the balconies.</p>

<p>At the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her. He
had dreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold. When he saw her
he sank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.</p>

<p class = "illustration left">

<p>“Your picture was beautiful,” he murmured, “but you are more
beautiful than your picture;” and the little Princess blushed.</p>

<p>“She was like a white rose before,” said a young page to his
neighbour, “but she is like a red rose now;” and the whole Court was
delighted.</p>

THE RUSSIAN PRINCESS</p>

<p>For the next three days everybody went
<span class = "pagenum">107</span>
about saying, “White rose, Red rose, Red rose, White rose;” and the King
gave orders that the Page’s salary was to be doubled. As he received no
salary at all this was not of much use to him, but it was considered a
great honour, and was duly published in the Court Gazette.</p>

<p>When the three days were over the marriage was celebrated. It was a
magnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand
under a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls. Then
there was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours. The Prince and
Princess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of
clear crystal. Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if
false lips touched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.</p>

<p>“It is quite clear that they love each other,” said the little Page,
“as clear as crystal!” and the King doubled his salary a second
time.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
<p>“What an honour!” cried all the courtiers.</p>

<p>After the banquet there was to be a Ball. The bride and bridegroom
were to dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play
the flute. He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him
so, because he was the King. Indeed, he knew only two airs, and was
never quite certain which one he was playing; but it made no matter,
for, whatever he did, everybody cried out, “Charming! charming!”</p>

The last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be
let off exactly at midnight. The little Princess had never seen a
firework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal
Pyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage.</p>

<p>“What are fireworks like?” she had asked the Prince, one morning, as
she was walking on the terrace.</p>

<p>“They are like the Aurora Borealis,” said the King, who always
answered questions that were addressed to other people, “only much more
natural. I&nbsp;prefer them to stars myself, as you always know when
they are going to appear, and they are as delightful as my own
flute-playing. You must certainly see them.”</p>

<p>So at the end of the King’s garden a great stand had been set up, and
as soon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper
place, the fireworks began to talk to each other.</p>

<p>“The King’s garden is not the world, you foolish Squib,” said a big
Roman Candle; “the
<span class = "pagenum">110</span>
world is an enormous place, and it would take you three days to see it
thoroughly.”</p>

<p>“Any place you love is the world to you,” exclaimed the pensive
Catherine Wheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life,
and prided herself on her broken heart; “but love is not fashionable any
more, the poets have killed it. They wrote so much about it that nobody
believed them, and I am not surprised. True love suffers, and is silent.
I&nbsp;remember myself once&mdash;&mdash; But it is no matter now.
Romance is a thing of the past.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said the Roman Candle, “Romance never dies. It is like
the moon, and lives for ever. The bride and bridegroom, for instance,
love each other very dearly. I&nbsp;heard all about them this morning
from a brown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in the same
drawer as myself, and he knew the latest Court news.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">111</span>
<p class = "figfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg111.png" width = "18" height = "411"
alt = "firework"></p>

<p>But the Catherine Wheel shook her head. “Romance is dead, Romance is
dead, Romance is dead,” she murmured. She was one of those people who
think that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times,
it becomes true in the end.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked
round.</p>

<p>It came from a tall, supercilious-looking Rocket, who was tied to the
end of a long stick. He always coughed before he made any observation,
so as to attract attention.</p>

<p>“Ahem! ahem!” he said, and everybody listened except the poor
Catherine Wheel, who was still shaking her head, and murmuring, “Romance
is dead.”</p>

<p>“Order! order!” cried out a Cracker. He was something of a
politician, and had always taken a prominent part in the local
elections, so he knew the proper Parliamentary expressions to use.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">112</span>
<p>“Quite dead,” whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to
sleep.</p>

<p>As soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time
and began. He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was
dictating his memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person
to whom he was talking. In fact, he had a most distinguished manner.</p>

<p>“How fortunate it is for the King’s son,” he remarked, “that he is to
be married on the very day on which I am to be let off! Really, if it
had been arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for
him; but Princes are always lucky.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” said the little Squib, “I thought it was quite the other
way, and that we were to be let off in the Prince’s honour.”</p>

<p>“It may be so with you,” he answered; “indeed, I have no doubt that
it is, but with
<span class = "pagenum">113</span>
me it is different. I&nbsp;am a very remarkable Rocket, and come of
remarkable parents. My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel of
her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing. When she made her
great public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went
out, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink
stars. She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very
best gunpowder. My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French
extraction. He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would
never come down again. He did, though, for he was of a kindly
disposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden
rain. The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering
terms. Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic
art.”</p>

<p>“Pyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean,” said
<span class = "pagenum">114</span>
a Bengal Light; “I&nbsp;know it is Pyrotechnic, for I saw it written on
my own canister.”</p>

<p>“Well, I said Pylotechnic,” answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of
voice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to
bully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of
some importance.</p>

<p>“I was saying,” continued the Rocket, “I was saying&mdash;&mdash;
What was I saying?”</p>

<p>“You were talking about yourself,” replied the Roman Candle.</p>

<p>“Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I
was so rudely interrupted. I&nbsp;hate rudeness and bad manners of every
kind, for I am extremely sensitive. No one in the whole world is so
sensitive as I am, I&nbsp;am quite sure of that.”</p>

</div>

<p>“What is a sensitive person?” said the Cracker to the Roman
Candle.</p>

<p class = "figfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg114.png" width = "205" height = "168"
alt = "exploding firework"></p>

<p>“A person who, because he has corns
<span class = "pagenum">115</span>
himself, always treads on other people’s toes,” answered the Roman
Candle in a low whisper; and the Cracker nearly exploded with
laughter.</p>

<p>“Pray, what are you laughing at?” inquired the Rocket; “I&nbsp;am not
laughing.”</p>

<p>“I am laughing because I am happy,” replied the Cracker.</p>

<p>“That is a very selfish reason,” said the Rocket angrily. “What right
have you to be happy? You should be thinking about others. In fact, you
should be thinking about me. I&nbsp;am always thinking about myself, and
I expect everybody else to do the same. That is what is called sympathy.
It is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree. Suppose,
for instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that
would be for every one! The Prince and Princess would never be happy
again, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King,
I&nbsp;know he would not get
<span class = "pagenum">116</span>
over it. Really, when I begin to reflect on the importance of my
position, I&nbsp;am almost moved to tears.”</p>

<p>“If you want to give pleasure to others,” cried the Roman Candle,
“you had better keep yourself dry.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” exclaimed the Bengal Light, who was now in better
spirits; “that is only common sense.”</p>

<p class = "leftfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg116.png" width = "23" height = "307"
alt = "firework"></p>

<p>“Common sense, indeed!” said the Rocket indignantly; “you forget that
I am very uncommon, and very remarkable. Why, anybody can have common
sense, provided that they have no imagination. But I have imagination,
for I never think of things as they really are; I&nbsp;always think of
them as being quite different. As for keeping myself dry, there is
evidently no one here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature.
Fortunately for myself, I&nbsp;don’t care. The only thing that sustains
one
<span class = "pagenum">117</span>
through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of
everybody else, and this is a feeling I have always cultivated. But none
of you have any hearts. Here you are laughing and making merry just as
if the Prince and Princess had not just been married.”</p>

<p class = "figfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg117.png" width = "158" height = "201"
alt = "fire-balloon"></p>

<p>“Well, really,” exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, “why not? It is a
most joyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell
the stars all about it. You will see them twinkle when I talk to them
about the pretty bride.”</p>

<p>“Ah! what a trivial view of life!” said the Rocket; “but it is only
what I expected. There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty. Why,
perhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there
is a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only
<span class = "pagenum">118</span>
son, a&nbsp;little fair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince
himself; and perhaps some day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and
perhaps the nurse may go to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps
the little boy may fall into the deep river and be drowned. What a
terrible misfortune! Poor people, to lose their only son! It is really
too dreadful! I&nbsp;shall never get over&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p>“But they have not lost their only son,” said the Roman Candle; “no
misfortune has happened to them at all.”</p>

<p>“I never said that they had,” replied the Rocket; “I&nbsp;said that
they might. If they had lost their only son there would be no use in
saying anything more about the matter. I&nbsp;hate people who cry over
spilt milk. But when I think that they might lose their only son,
I&nbsp;certainly am much affected.”</p>

<p class = "illustration left">
<img src = "images/b_pg118.png" width = "172" height = "62"
alt = "woman on bench"></p>

<p>“You certainly are!” cried the Bengal Light.
<span class = "pagenum">119</span>
“In fact, you are the most affected person I ever met.”</p>

<p>“You are the rudest person I ever met,” said the Rocket, “and you
cannot understand my friendship for the Prince.”</p>

<p>“Why, you don’t even know him,” growled the Roman Candle.</p>

<p>“I never said I knew him,” answered the Rocket. “I dare say that if I
knew him I should not be his friend at all. It is a very dangerous thing
to know one’s friends.”</p>

<p>“You had really better keep yourself dry,” said the Fire-balloon.
“That is the important thing.”</p>

<p>“Very important for you, I have no doubt,” answered the Rocket, “but
I shall weep if I choose;” and he actually burst into real tears, which
flowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little
beetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together,
<span class = "pagenum">120</span>
and were looking for a nice dry spot to live&nbsp;in.</p>

<p>“He must have a truly romantic nature,” said the Catherine Wheel,
“for he weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about;” and she
heaved a deep sigh and thought about the deal box.</p>

<p>But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and
kept saying, “Humbug! humbug!” at the top of their voices. They were
extremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called
it humbug.</p>

<p>Then the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars
began to shine, and a sound of music came from the palace.</p>

<p>The Prince and Princess were leading the dance. They danced so
beautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and
watched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat
time.</p>

and then twelve, and at the last stroke of midnight every one came out
on the terrace, and the King sent for the Royal Pyrotechnist.</p>

<p>“Let the fireworks begin,” said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist
made a low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden. He had six
attendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of
a long pole.</p>

place, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet. “Good-bye,”
cried the Fire-balloon as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks.
Bang! Bang! answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves
immensely. Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket.
He
<span class = "pagenum">122</span>
was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all. The best thing
in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it was of
no use. All his poor relations, to whom he would never speak, except
with a sneer, shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers with
blossoms of fire. Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court; and the little Princess
laughed with pleasure.</p>

Rocket; “no doubt that is what it means,” and he looked more

<p>The next day the workmen came to put everything tidy. “This is
evidently a deputation,” said the Rocket; “I&nbsp;will receive them with
becoming dignity”: so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown
severely as if he were thinking about some very important subject. But
they took no notice of him at
<span class = "pagenum">123</span>
all till they were just going away. Then one of them caught sight of
him. “Hallo!” he cried, “what a bad rocket!” and he threw him over the
wall into the ditch.</p>

<p>“<span class = "smallcaps">Bad</span> Rocket? <span class =
"smallcaps">Bad</span> Rocket?” he said, as he whirled through the air;
“impossible! <span class = "smallcaps">Grand</span> Rocket, that is what
the man said. <span class = "smallcaps">Bad</span> and <span class =
"smallcaps">Grand</span> sound very much the same, indeed they often are

<p class = "figfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg123.png" width = "145" height = "202"

<p>“It is not comfortable here,” he remarked, “but no doubt it is some
fashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my
health. My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require
rest.”</p>

<p>Then a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled
coat, swam up to him.</p>

<p>“A new arrival, I see!” said the Frog. “Well, after all there is
nothing like mud. Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am
<span class = "pagenum">124</span>
quite happy. Do you think it will be a wet afternoon? I&nbsp;am sure I
hope so, but the sky is quite blue and cloudless. What a pity!”</p>

<p>“Ahem! ahem!” said the Rocket, and he began to cough.</p>

<p>“What a delightful voice you have!” cried the Frog. “Really it is
quite like a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in
the world. You will hear our glee-club this evening. We sit in the old
duck pond close by the farmer’s house, and as soon as the moon rises we
begin. It is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us. In
fact, it was only yesterday that I heard the farmer’s wife say to her
mother that she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.
It is most gratifying to find oneself so popular.”</p>

<p>“Ahem! ahem!” said the Rocket angrily. He was very much annoyed that
he could not get a word&nbsp;in.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">125</span>
<p>“A delightful voice, certainly,” continued the Frog; “I&nbsp;hope you
will come over to the duck-pond. I&nbsp;am off to look for my daughters.
I&nbsp;have six beautiful daughters, and I am so afraid the Pike may
meet them. He is a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in
breakfasting off them. Well, good-bye: I&nbsp;have enjoyed our
conversation very much, I&nbsp;assure you.”</p>

<p>“Conversation, indeed!” said the Rocket. “You have talked the whole
time yourself. That is not conversation.”</p>

<p>“Somebody must listen,” answered the Frog, “and I like to do all the
talking myself. It saves time, and prevents arguments.”</p>

<p>“But I like arguments,” said the Rocket.</p>

<p>“I hope not,” said the Frog complacently. “Arguments are extremely
vulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions.
Good-bye a second time; I&nbsp;see my daughters
<span class = "pagenum">126</span>
in the distance;” and the little Frog swam away.</p>

<p>“You are a very irritating person,” said the Rocket, “and very
ill-bred. I&nbsp;hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when
one wants to talk about oneself, as I do. It is what I call selfishness,
and selfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my
temperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature. In fact, you
should take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model.
Now that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I
am going back to Court almost immediately. I&nbsp;am a great favourite
at Court; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my
honour. Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a
provincial.”</p>

<p>“There is no good talking to him,” said a dragon-fly, who was sitting
on the top of a
<span class = "pagenum">127</span>
large brown bulrush; “no good at all, for he has gone away.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is his loss, not mine,” answered the Rocket. “I&nbsp;am
not going to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.
I&nbsp;like hearing myself talk. It is one of my greatest pleasures.
I&nbsp;often have long conversations all by myself, and I am so clever
that sometimes I don’t understand a single word of what I am
saying.”</p>

<p>“Then you should certainly lecture on Philosophy,” said the
Dragon-fly, and he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away

<p>“How very silly of him not to stay here!” said the Rocket. “I&nbsp;am
sure that he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind.
However, I&nbsp;don’t care a bit. Genius like mine is sure to be
appreciated some day;” and he sank down a little deeper into the
mud.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">128</span>
<p>After some time a large White Duck swam up to him. She had yellow
legs, and webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of
her waddle.</p>

<p>“Quack, quack, quack,” she said. “What a curious shape you are! May I
ask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?”</p>

<p>“It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country,”
answered the Rocket, “otherwise you would know who I am. However,
I&nbsp;excuse your ignorance. It would be unfair to expect other people
to be as remarkable as oneself. You will no doubt be surprised to hear
that I can fly up into the sky, and come down in a shower of golden
rain.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think much of that,” said the Duck, “as I cannot see what
use it is to any one. Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox,
or draw a cart like the horse, or look after the
<span class = "pagenum">129</span>
sheep like the collie-dog, that would be something.”</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/b_pg128.png" width = "413" height = "33"
alt = "duck"></p>

<p>“My good creature,” cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice,
“I&nbsp;see that you belong to the lower orders. A&nbsp;person of my
position is never useful. We have certain accomplishments, and that is
more than sufficient. I&nbsp;have no sympathy myself with industry of
any kind, least of all with such industries as you seem to recommend.
Indeed, I&nbsp;have always been of opinion that hard work is simply the
refuge of people who have nothing whatever to&nbsp;do.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said the Duck, who was of a very peaceable disposition,
and never quarrelled with any one, “everybody has different tastes.
I&nbsp;hope, at any rate, that you are going to take up your residence
here.”</p>

<p>“Oh! dear no,” cried the Rocket. “I am merely a visitor,
a&nbsp;distinguished visitor. The
<span class = "pagenum">130</span>
fact is that I find this place rather tedious. There is neither society
here, nor solitude. In fact, it is essentially suburban. I&nbsp;shall
probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make a
sensation in the world.”</p>

<p>“I had thoughts of entering public life once myself,” remarked the
Duck; “there are so many things that need reforming. Indeed, I&nbsp;took
the chair at a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions
condemning everything that we did not like. However, they did not seem
to have much effect. Now I go in for domesticity, and look after my
family.”</p>

<p>“I am made for public life,” said the Rocket, “and so are all my
relations, even the humblest of them. Whenever we appear we excite great
attention. I&nbsp;have not actually appeared myself, but when I do so it
will be a magnificent sight. As for domesticity, it ages one rapidly,
and distracts one’s mind from higher things.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">131</span>
<p>“Ah! the higher things of life, how fine they are!” said the Duck;
“and that reminds me how hungry I feel:” and she swam away down the
stream, saying, “Quack, quack, quack.”</p>

<p class = "figfloat">
<img src = "images/b_pg131.png" width = "253" height = "259"
alt = "children in silhouette"></p>

<p>“Come back! come back!” screamed the Rocket, “I have a great deal to
say to you;” but the Duck paid no attention to him. “I&nbsp;am glad that
she has gone,” he said to himself, “she has a decidedly middle-class
mind;” and he sank a little deeper still into the mud, and began to
think about the loneliness of genius, when suddenly two little boys in
white smocks came running down the bank, with a kettle and some
faggots.</p>

<p>“This must be the deputation,” said the Rocket, and he tried to look
very dignified.</p>

<p>“Hallo!” cried one of the boys, “look at
<span class = "pagenum">132</span>
this old stick! I&nbsp;wonder how it came here;” and he picked the
Rocket out of the ditch.</p>

<p>“<span class = "smallcaps">Old</span> Stick!” said the Rocket,
“impossible! <span class = "smallcaps">Gold</span> Stick, that is what
he said. Gold Stick is very complimentary. In fact, he mistakes me for
one of the Court dignitaries!”</p>

<p>“Let us put it into the fire!” said the other boy, “it will help to
boil the kettle.”</p>

<p>So they piled the faggots together, and put the Rocket on top, and
lit the fire.</p>

<p>“This is magnificent,” cried the Rocket, “they are going to let me
off in broad daylight, so that everyone can see&nbsp;me.”</p>

<p>“We will go to sleep now,” they said, “and when we wake up the kettle
will be boiled;” and they lay down on the grass, and shut their
eyes.</p>

<p>The Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn. At last,
however, the fire caught him.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">133</span>
<p>“Now I am going off!” he cried, and he made himself very stiff and
straight. “I&nbsp;know I shall go much higher than the stars, much
higher than the moon, much higher than the sun. In fact, I&nbsp;shall go
so high that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Fizz! Fizz! Fizz! and he went straight up into the air.</p>

<p>“Delightful,” he cried, “I shall go on like this for ever. What a
success I&nbsp;am!”</p>

<p>But nobody saw him.</p>

<p>Then he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.</p>

<p>“Now I am going to explode,” he cried. “I shall set the whole world
on fire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else
for a whole year.” And he certainly did explode. Bang! Bang! Bang! went
the gunpowder. There was no doubt about&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>But nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were
sound asleep.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">134</span>
<p>Then all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on
the back of a Goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch.</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” cried the Goose. “It is going to rain sticks;” and
she rushed into the water.</p>

<p>“I knew I should create a great sensation,” gasped the Rocket, and he
went out.</p>
